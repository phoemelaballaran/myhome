                    I was on my way to my dad's childhood home in an island in Bicol. No boat was available to
                    transport me from the shore where I was to the island. I decided to swim instead but didn't get very far.

                    Someone died. Everyone was pretty okay about it, I was the only one who knew the gravity of that loss. 
                    In my grief, I decided to live near the sea. A resident of the area cautioned me about how hard it was 
                    to live there (unreliable water and electricity supply, poor data signal, no internet connection). I 
                    said I didn't mind. Felt like that's where I was supposed to be.

                    I dreamed of my very close friends from grade school, high school, college. I was happy. We were walking 
                    home from school. You know how people tend to partner up when walking with a big group? I ended up walking 
                    side by side F. For some reason, we decided to say “meow” whenever we saw a cat (so many stray cats in my 
                    dream).

                    I was younger in the dream. A boy handed my sister a letter for me. In the letter, he expressed his desire 
                    to talk to me about a particular book. He asked me if I’d be interested to go out and discuss the book with 
                    him. I saw him multiple times whenever I went out of the house or looked out the window. He was always 
                    smiling and playing with stray cats. At one time, we're both in a store and he smiled at me. I was too shy 
                    to smile back or say, "Hello, I received your letter and I want to talk about that book with you."

                    It was nighttime and everyone in the neighborhood was outside. There seemed to be a festival where stray 
                    cats march through the street and enter each home. People in my dream thought this will bring in good luck. As the 
                    cats entered the house beside our family’s home, I worried that it might be too tiring for the cats to bless every 
                    home in our street.

                <p>There was a huge concrete water slide. I was at the top, in front of me was a musician. He seemed
                    sad, but not melancholic sad, more like "the world is too beautiful and I cannot take it" sad. As he
                    was about to go down the slide, I hurriedly put together a collage with a line from his song and 3
                    pieces of magazine cutouts so I could show him that someone appreciates his art. I managed to finish
                    the collage in time. He smiled as I handed it to him, then he went down the slide. I followed him,
                    surprised to discover that the end of the slide was in nearshore waters instead of a swimming pool.
                    The musician was standing not far from where I landed. He transformed into someone I'm in love
                    with in waking life.</p>
